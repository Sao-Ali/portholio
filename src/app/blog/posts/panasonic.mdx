# Bridging Hardware and Software ‚úàÔ∏èüíª

At **Panasonic Avionics**, I joined the software engineering team focused on improving how avionics technicians interact with Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) fault data. The challenge was simple to describe but complex to solve: **take raw hardware faults buried deep in C++ logic and turn them into something clear, usable, and portable.**

## Connecting C++ to JavaScript

Faults originated in **low-level C++ bindings**, but technicians relied on a **JavaScript-driven interface**. I built the bridge that let fault data move cleanly between those layers.

- **Why this mattered**: without the bridge, engineers had to rely on manual log inspection, which was slow and error-prone.
- **What I learned**: careful design of the data interface ensured that technicians saw *exactly what the hardware reported* without unnecessary complexity.

This step was critical for real-time visibility: if an aircraft fault occurs, the data pipeline must be accurate and immediate.

## Displaying & Exporting Faults

Once the data was accessible, my next task was to make it **useful**:

- **Display**: I integrated the faults into the front-end interface so they could be filtered, sorted, and read at a glance. Clear visualization reduced misdiagnosis time and helped engineers act faster.
- **Export API**: I designed an API that allowed faults to be exported as structured reports. This meant engineers could review data off-system or archive it for compliance.
- **Removable devices**: I built detection logic for devices like USB drives so reports could be securely saved in the field.

- **Why this mattered**: exporting transformed the interface from a reactive tool into a proactive workflow. Engineers no longer just *saw* faults ‚Äî they could take them with them, share them, and plug them into larger analysis pipelines.

## Full-Stack Problem Solving

The project required me to operate across the stack:

- **Systems programming**: extending and interpreting C++ bindings safely.
- **Frontend integration**: rendering live fault data with clarity and responsiveness.
- **Infrastructure**: building APIs and device-handling logic that had to be resilient in constrained, safety-critical environments.

Each layer had its own challenges ‚Äî from memory safety on the C++ side to state synchronization in the UI. Working end-to-end taught me to see how *every engineering decision ripples through the system.*

## Takeaway ‚ú®

This project sharpened my ability to **bridge software with hardware workflows**. By connecting low-level C++ logic to a modern JavaScript interface, designing APIs for exporting, and handling removable device logic, I learned how thoughtful engineering can shave hours off testing cycles and reduce real-world operational risk.

The broader lesson: **good software isn‚Äôt just about making data visible ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making it actionable.** At Panasonic, I saw firsthand how bridging that gap can improve reliability and efficiency in mission-critical systems, and that‚Äôs the space I want to keep working in.

# First Blog Post ðŸš€

I finally decided to start this blog. Now that Iâ€™m no longer at Panasonic, I wanted a place to just write out my thoughts, explain what Iâ€™m working on, and track where Iâ€™m headed. Feels like the right time to start documenting things, especially with so much going on.

## Life update

Iâ€™m heading into my junior year as a Computer Engineering student, and Iâ€™m **souper excited** (yes, *souper*). Iâ€™ve been grinding nonstop, and this semester Iâ€™m taking on a heavier load â€” **20 units**. It sounds like a lot (and it is), but Iâ€™m hyped for these classes because theyâ€™re more software-heavy.

For example, Iâ€™m finally taking a formal **Data Structures & Algorithms** course (EECS 40). Even though Iâ€™ve already been deep in LeetCode, itâ€™ll be nice to see how the class approaches it and fill in any gaps.

## Senior Design: HFT Project ðŸ’»âš¡

Iâ€™m part of a **senior design team** working on a **high-frequency trading (HFT) platform**. My role is mainly focused on the **UI and frontend side**, but Iâ€™ll also be building the **web socket connection** that pulls data straight from the FPGA.

That means I need to:
- Get started on the UI (lots of **graphs and tables** to display real-time data).
- Make sure everything connects seamlessly with the FPGA so the frontend updates without lag.
- Balance designing something that looks good while staying functional and fast.

Itâ€™s definitely a big challenge, but honestly this is the kind of stuff I want to do â€” the intersection of hardware + software + systems.

## Keeping my hardware side alive ðŸ”§

Even though Iâ€™m doing more software lately, I donâ€™t want to let go of my hardware roots. Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting involved with another **official design project** on the side.

One group that really stood out to me is **Nominal**. Theyâ€™re working on streamlining **hardware testing using software tools**. That mix of *embedded* + *infrastructure* feels exactly like where I want to be long term. Itâ€™s something I definitely want to bring into whatever company or team I end up at.

## Looking ahead ðŸŽ¯

Iâ€™m starting to prep for **software engineering internships** and plan to apply as positions open up. Iâ€™m especially looking at **smaller companies** where I can get more hands-on impact, but Iâ€™m open to whatever gets me closer to where I want to be â€” building systems that actually matter.

For now, this blog will be my spot to:
- Reflect on what Iâ€™m learning.
- Break down projects Iâ€™m working on.
- Document both the wins and the struggles.

This is just the beginning, but it feels good to have a place to write things out. Hereâ€™s to the start of my blogging journey ðŸ™Œ.
